# Nine edges on five vertices

A simple graph on five vertices with nine edges is the complete graph with one edge deleted.
Nine edges force every degree to be at least three: a vertex of degree at most two leaves at
most six edges on the other four vertices, and six plus two is eight. The degree sum is then
eighteen, so the degrees are three `4`s and two `3`s. A vertex of degree four is adjacent to
every other vertex, so the complement is the single edge joining the two vertices of degree
three.

Chaffee and Noble, Australas. J. Combin. **64(2)** (2016), 327–333, Theorem 7, assert that on
five vertices the degree sequence `(4, 4, 4, 3, 3)` corresponds solely to the complete graph
with one edge deleted.

/-- A simple graph on five vertices with nine edges is the complete graph with one edge deleted.

Nine edges force every degree to be at least three. The degree sum is then eighteen, so the
degrees are three `4`s and two `3`s; each degree-`4` vertex is adjacent to every other vertex,
and the complement is the edge joining the two degree-`3` vertices.

Chaffee and Noble assert that the degree sequence `(4, 4, 4, 3, 3)` corresponds solely to this
graph, in the proof of their Theorem 7. -/
